 *  - this file as well as the "threading_alt_template.h" files are renamed
 *     and copied under the project source tree.
 *
 *  - The project seetings are pointing to the correct CMSIS-RTOS files
 *
 *  - the mbedTLS config file is enabling the flags "MBEDTLS_THREADING_C" and
 *    "MBEDTLS_THREADING_ALT"
 *
 *  - the mbedtls_set_threading_alt(...) is called before any other mbedtls
 *   API, in order to register the cmisis_os_mutex_xxx() API.
