This file contains template files that provide some alternate implmentation for
mbedTLS algorithms.

net_sockets_template.c
-------------------------
implements of the mbedTLS networking API using the LwIP TCP/IP Stack.
This file implments the strict minimum required to ensure TCP/IP connection.
This file need to be copied at user level an renamed to "net_sockets.c"

rng_alt_tempate.c
---------------------
Implments the function mbedtls_hardware_poll(), required by mbedTLS to generate
random numbers. The function is using the HAL/RNG API to generate random number
using the rng hw IP.

threading_alt_template.[c/h]
-----------------------------
Immplement the mutex management API required by mbedTLS, using the CMSIS-RTOS
V1 & V2 API
